AQI Prediction Using Machine Learning

Abstract

Air pollution is a significant threat to public health and the environment, especially in developing regions like Gujarat, India. This project leverages machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and XGBoost, to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) based on key pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx). Achieving over 99% accuracy, the models provide valuable insights into pollutant impacts and the role of meteorological factors, enabling robust early warning systems and informed policymaking.

Introduction

Air pollution poses severe risks to health and ecosystems, driven by industrial processes, vehicular emissions, and agricultural activities. Traditional prediction methods often fail to capture the intricate relationships between pollutants and meteorological factors. This project applies machine learning to predict AQI and identifies critical factors affecting air quality in Gujarat.

Factors Contributing to Air Pollution

Industrial Processes: Emissions of SO2, NOx, CO

Vehicular Emissions: Release of CO, NOx, hydrocarbons

Agricultural Activities: Burning of waste, fertilizer use

Household Activities: Emissions from cooking and waste burning

AQI Categories

Good (0-50): Minimal impact

Moderate (51-100): Mild impact for sensitive individuals

Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150): Health concerns for sensitive individuals

Unhealthy (151-200): General discomfort

Very Unhealthy (201-300): Respiratory issues for everyone

Hazardous (301-500): Serious health effects

Data Analysis Tools

Scikit-learn: Implementing and evaluating ML models

Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing

Matplotlib: Visualization and result representation

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and addressed missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns and relationships.

Feature Engineering: Enhanced predictive power by refining key features.

Model Training: Applied Random Forest and XGBoost on pollutant data from 2007 to 2021.

Analysis and Results

The models achieved over 99% accuracy in predicting AQI. PM2.5 and PM10 emerged as the most critical pollutants, while meteorological factors like maximum temperature significantly influenced AQI variations.

Conclusions

Machine learning algorithms demonstrate exceptional capability in predicting AQI, providing actionable insights for emission control and climate adaptation strategies. This research emphasizes the need for stringent policies targeting PM2.5 and PM10 emissions.
